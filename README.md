Fraudulent Job Prediction Tool
Problem Statement:
The rise of online job portals has simplified job hunting but also brought about a surge in fraudulent job postings, exposing job seekers to financial scams and identity theft. To address this, our project aims to develop a machine learning tool that distinguishes between genuine and fraudulent job postings.

Objective:
Our primary goal is to create a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether a job posting is legitimate or fraudulent, thus empowering job seekers to make informed decisions and avoid potential risks.

Our secondary goal is to identfiy attributes of fake postings

Approach:
We employ various machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate our prediction model. The algorithms utilized include:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Tree Classifier
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
XGBoost

Enhancements:

Feature Engineering: Explore additional features such as:
Text analysis of job descriptions for keywords indicating legitimacy or fraudulence.
Analysis of company profiles and historical data for credibility assessment.

Ensemble Techniques: Implement ensemble learning methods like:
Voting classifiers to combine predictions from multiple models.



Conclusion:
By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and enhancing model interpretability, our tool aims to provide job seekers with a reliable means of identifying fraudulent job postings, thereby safeguarding them from potential financial and identity-related risks. Through ongoing refinement and adaptation, we strive to create a robust solution that addresses the evolving landscape of online job fraud.
